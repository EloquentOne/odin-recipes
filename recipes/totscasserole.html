    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A baked potato in the air fryer comes out beautifully crusty on the 
        outside and light and fluffy on the inside, just what a great baked 
        potato should be! Serve them with your favorite toppings, like sour 
        cream, butter, or chives.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground

            season with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
